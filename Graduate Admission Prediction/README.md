# Description

This is a regression-based prediction problem set that allows us to predict the admission chances of students to get admitted into PG programs based on various factors like GRE scores, TOEFL scores, Undergraduate GPA, Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation and Research Experience.

# Overview

In this project, a Machine Learning based method is used where we compare different regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest, AdaboostRegressor, Lasso and Ridge given the profile of the student. We then compute error functions for the different models and compare their performance to select the best performing model.
