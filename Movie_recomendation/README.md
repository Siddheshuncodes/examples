# Description

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict top 5 similar movies using the TMDB credit and TMDB movies dataset. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the similar movies based on various features, such as overview, Actors, crew and genres.

# Overview

Our machine learning project aims to develop an movie recommendation project using a dataset comprising approximately 5,000 movies. By harnessing the power of cutting-edge algorithms and data analysis, our system will provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on the provided movie name. This project will enhance user experiences, increase engagement, and drive user satisfaction.
